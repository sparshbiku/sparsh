        <h5 class="mb-1">Why do we need to new charitable organization while there are so many of them ?</h5>
        
      </div>
      <p class="mb-1">Most of us are very interested in donating for good causes but always fear if the money we are donating is reaching the right people. Big Charitable organizations suffer from issues with part of donation going towards administrative fee, and a whole chain of links before reaching the needy. The concern is how much percentage of donated amount will reach the needy.
        The main goal of our organization is to make sure 100% of our donations reach the needy with $0 administrative fee since all work is voluntary and no overheads</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">How do I become a member?</h5>
        
      </div>
      <p class="mb-1">Just start donating as little as $5 a month to become a member. You get voting rights to vote where the collected funds will go. All members would have equal voting rights independent of how much you donate. There are no leaders in the organization, every member is a leader and is expected to lead this momentum. Please talk to all your friends and make this grow.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Are you affiliated to any religious organization?</h5>

      <p class="mb-1">We are not affiliated with any religious organization or intend to donate to specific religious organizations abroad.</p>

        <h5 class="mb-1">Where would the funds go?</h5>
        
      </div>
      <p class="mb-1"> We intend to find some good, reliable organizations abroad to donate the money which will have the same basic goal of 100% of money reaching the needy and 0 administrative costs. If any of the members do forward such organization names the contribution will be decided through a voting system.</p>
