        <p class="lead">We are a group of friends that have come together with a shared vision; ensure each cent of the money we donate each year reaches the needy. 
            We do this by volunteering ourselves and encouraging friends/family to volunteer such that there is no administrative cost and even if there is one we pick up the tab ourselves.
            We do not have any management team. We are all Sparsh family members. Every person who joins the organization by donating as little as $5 monthly 
            is a member and has voting rights to decide how to utilize the money that is collected.</p>
